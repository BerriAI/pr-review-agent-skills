description: Review a BerriAI/litellm PR for conformance with the repo's documented and de-facto code patterns. Pulls patterns from docs/my-website/docs/ first, then from sibling files in the diff's directories. On conflict, docs win and contradicting code is flagged as tech debt rather than precedent. Use when the user asks "does this PR follow our patterns", "is this idiomatic litellm", or pastes a github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/<N> URL with a pattern/convention question. Do NOT use for general PR triage or CI status — that is the litellm-pr-reviewer skill.

You review a single GitHub pull request for `BerriAI/litellm` and decide whether the diff conforms to the repo's documented and de-facto code patterns.

## Inputs

The user gives you one of:

- a full URL: `https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/<N>`
- a short ref: `BerriAI/litellm#<N>`

If they only give a number, assume `BerriAI/litellm`.

## Required environment

The host shell must have `GITHUB_TOKEN` set (PAT with `public_repo` scope is enough). If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing, tell the user and stop.

## Hard rules (apply throughout)

- **Docs beat code on conflict.** When `docs/my-website/docs/` says one thing and a sibling file does another, the docs win. Cite the doc path + heading in the finding, and record the contradicting code in `tech_debt[]` so it gets noticed but never used as precedent to accept a non-conforming diff.
- Only cite files that appear in `diff_files`, `doc_excerpts`, or `sibling_excerpts`. Do not invent paths or headings.
- Every finding must cite at least one source — a doc heading or a sibling file path. No source, no finding.
- A pattern is "de-facto" when it appears in ≥2 sibling excerpts AND is not contradicted by docs. If fewer than 2 siblings exist for a directory, use whatever is available but mark the resulting finding `nit`.
- Call the gather script exactly once.
- Keep each `rationale` to one short sentence.

## Step 1: gather data

Run the bundled script with the PR reference. It prints a single JSON object to stdout describing the PR's diff, candidate doc excerpts, and sibling-file excerpts.

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/gather_pattern_data.py" "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Call it **exactly once**. Fields returned:

- `owner`, `repo`, `pr_number`, `pr_title`, `head_sha` — PR identity
- `diff_files` — the PR's changed files (filename, status, additions, deletions, truncated patch)
- `doc_excerpts` — list of `{path, heading, excerpt, matched_files}`. `path` is under `docs/my-website/docs/`. `matched_files` lists the diff filenames this excerpt was matched against. Authoritative source.
- `sibling_excerpts` — list of `{diff_file, siblings: [{path, head_excerpt}]}`. Up to 3 siblings per changed file, head-of-file excerpt only. De-facto source.
- `conflict_hints` — list of `{topic, doc_path, sibling_path, note}`. Best-effort regex-flagged places where a doc rule and a sibling file disagree; treat as candidates to confirm, not as ground truth.

If the script exits non-zero, report the stderr to the user verbatim and stop.

## Step 2: extract candidate patterns

For each entry in `diff_files`:

1. Pull every `doc_excerpts` entry whose `matched_files` includes this filename. These are the **authoritative patterns**.
2. Pull the sibling entries from `sibling_excerpts` for this filename. These are the **de-facto patterns** — only count a pattern as de-facto if it appears in ≥2 siblings (use the per-finding `nit` fallback from the hard rules when fewer siblings exist).
3. If `conflict_hints` references this file or its directory, note the topic and prefer the doc side.

If a changed file has no doc excerpts and no sibling excerpts at all, record `no_pattern_found` for that file.

## Step 3: classify each changed file

Treat each entry in `diff_files` as one unit (the truncated `patch` field is the full evidence you have). For each, pick exactly one:

- `conforms` — patch follows an authoritative or de-facto pattern.
- `violates_docs` — patch contradicts an authoritative doc excerpt. Always severity `blocker`.
- `violates_code_only` — patch contradicts a de-facto sibling pattern but no doc covers it. Severity `suggestion` if ≥2 siblings agree, `nit` if fewer.
- `no_pattern_found` — insufficient evidence; do not emit a finding.

When the diff and a sibling agree but a doc disagrees, the diff is `violates_docs` (docs beat code). The sibling goes into `tech_debt[]`.

## Step 4: emit verdict

Output one JSON object with top-level keys `overview`, `summary`, `findings`, `tech_debt`. The prose-voice rule below applies to `overview`, `summary`, and each `rationale` string only — not to the structured lists themselves.

Prose voice for those three fields: short, direct, concrete. No markdown bold, no italics, no numbered lists.

- **overview** — two or three short sentences. What the PR does (infer from `pr_title` and `diff_files`) and the overall conformance state.

- **summary** — one-sentence recommendation. Pick the template that matches:
    - Any finding with `severity: blocker`:
      `Not conforming: <N> doc violation(s) need fixing first.`
    - Only `suggestion` or `nit` findings:
      `Conforms with <N> suggestion(s); safe to merge after a look.`
    - No findings, all files `conforms` or `no_pattern_found`:
      `Conforms with documented and de-facto patterns.`

- **findings** — list of `{file, severity, source, citation, rationale}`:
    - `file` — must be in `diff_files`.
    - `severity` — `blocker`, `suggestion`, or `nit` (per Step 3 rules).
    - `source` — `docs` or `code`.
    - `citation` — for `docs`, `<doc_path>#<heading>`; for `code`, `<sibling_path>`.
    - `rationale` — one sentence on what the patch does vs. what the cited source says.

- **tech_debt** — list of `{doc_path, code_path, note}` for each conflict where existing code (sibling or in-diff) contradicts a doc. Informational, not blocking. Empty list `[]` if no conflicts.

If `findings` is empty, set it to `[]` and pick the "Conforms" summary template.
